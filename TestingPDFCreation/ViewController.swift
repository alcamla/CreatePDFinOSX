     An example of generating a PDF using pure *Quartz 2D* pipeline.

     ### Important note when working with Quartz
     The coordinate system of quartz is different from the coordinate system in iOS higher order API's, such as TextKit. The origin is on 
     the bottom left corner, the Y coordinate increases upwards and the X coordinate increases to the right.
